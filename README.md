# budget-tracker
This app allows users to enter budget information and save it in a database.
The user's spending/earning activity will be displayed in a line chart below the budget input fields.

If the user's internet connection is interrupted at any point they will still be able to add new expenses/incomes and update their chart locally.  The information entered offline will be stored in the local indexedDB and submitted to the actual database as soon as the internet connection is restored.
